# EDA-Projects
1. EDA using Python : The production company wants to analyze a movie dataset to understand the factors that contribute to commercial success and high ratings.
By examining patterns and trends in the data, the company hopes to identify which genres tend to perform well at the box office and other key drivers of success.
This knowledge can be used to predict the performance of future movies and inform decisions around production strategies. Ultimately, the goal is to increase the
likelihood of creating hit movies by taking a data-driven approach to understanding audience preferences and behavior.

2. MovieOnRent is a movie rental store with a vast collection of movies in DVDs and blue ray disc formats. The management wants to analyze the data to understand
 what kind of movies and actors are often rented. This analysis would help stock up the inventory of movies to improve their business.

3. The goal of this analysis is to explore a dataset containing information on bank customers and their payment behavior, and to use data visualization techniques
 in Tableau to gain insights into the factors that contribute to attrition from bank.

   In this analysis , we will use Python libraries such as Pandas to explore the dataset, perform data cleaning and preprocessing, and create visualizations by using 
   tableau to analyze the data.
